Personalised Spam Filter for Social Network Using Machine Learning Algorithm

Spam messages means an irrelevant and unsolicited message sent by an unknown user which may lead to a sense of
insecurity among users. These messages affect user’s emotions and privacy and hence affect the lives of individuals. To
deal with this problem there are a numerous spam detecting and filtering applications available in market. Most of these
applications detect the spam messages by manually giving choice to the users whether message is spam or ham. The technic
used by these applications reduces the spread of spam and rumoured messages but this leads to another problem i.e. user
needs to read all the message spam then categories it as a spam and ham which is a time-consuming process.
This paper comes up with a solution for classifying user’s messages into different classes and displaying only those which
the user wants. The messages which belong to the class which user does not want is classified as spam messages. This
classification process is done with the help of three machine learning algorithm, classifying each and every message of the
user.
